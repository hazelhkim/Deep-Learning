# Feedforward
Feedforward is the process neural networks use to turn the input into an output.

#### We need to learn how to train the neural network, once we know how to define them.
Training them really means what parameters should they have on the edges in order to model our data well.
- In order to learn how to train them, we need to look carefully at how they process the input to obtain an output
  - Let's look at out simplest neural network, a **perceptron**.
  - The perceptron is defined by a linear equation.
    - This perceptron receives a data point of the form x1, x2.
  - We have thick edges corresonding to large weights and thin edges corresponding to small weights.
  - The neural network plots the point in the top graph and also in the bottom graph
    - The outputs coming out will be a small number from the top model. The point lies in the red area which means it has a small probability of being blue. 
    - The output from the bottom model is relatively a large number, since the point lies in the blue area which means it has a large probability of being blue. 
  - Now as the two models get combined into this nonlinear model and the output layer just plots the point and it tells the 
  probability that the point is blue. 
    - As you can see, this is a bad model because it puts the point in the red area and the point is blue.
