#### Non-linear Data

We've been dealing a lot with data sets that can be separated by a line. But as you can imagine the real world is much more cmoplex than that.
This is where neural networks can show their full potential. Now we'll see how to deal with more complicated data sets that require
highly non-linear boundaries.

#### Non-Linear Models

Let's see some data that is not linearly separable.

Everything will be the same as before except this equation won't be linear and that's where neural networks come into play.

## Neural Network Architecture
Put these building blocks together to build a great Neural Network. ( or, multi-layer perceptrons. )

Those images will show us how to combine two perceptrons into a third, more complicated one. 

- Combine two linear models into a nonlinear model as follows. 
- we can see that this Neural Network uses a Sigmoid Activation Function and the Perceptrons.
