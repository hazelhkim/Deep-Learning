# First Neural Network
## Bike Sharing Prediction

In this project, I'll build and train my own Neural Network from scrach to predict the nubmer of bikeshare users on a given day.
<br />

Imagine yourself owning a bike sharing company. You want to protect how many bikes you need because if you have too few, you're losing money from potential riders.
If I have too many, I'm wasting money on bikes that are just sitting around. So I need to predict from historical data how many bikes I'll need in the near future. 
A good way to do this is with a neural network, which is exactly what I'll do. 

<br />
I will implement the neural network and train it on historical data to make predictions.

- First, load and prepare the data. (I provided the code to prepare the data but I'll be learning how to do all this in a future lesson.)
- Second, train the network and view its performance as it's being trained.
- Third, compare my networks predictions with actual data. If I build my network right, I should find the network does a really good job for the most part.

### About Data : 

#### Background
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

#### Data Set
- Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. 
- The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data.
- The data is aggregated on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com. 

#### Files
- hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. 
    - Records : 17379 hours
- day.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. 
    - Records : 731 days
